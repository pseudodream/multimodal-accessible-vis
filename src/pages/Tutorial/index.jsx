            the chart image. To navigate through the underlying data of the
            chart, a corresponding data table is provided below the chart. You
            can use your screen reader to browse through the data table. You can
            sort the table by clicking the headers.

              For the Multimodal method, you use the arrow keys of
              your keyboard to navigate through different layers of the chart.
              Each layer has a different level of detail and you can move
              between the levels using "up" and "down" arrow keys. At the top
              layer, you have the chart summary. When you press "down", you will
              have a chart encoding layer such as a horizontal axis, vertical
              axis, or color legend. Below, you have data groups and individual
              data values.
            </p>
            <p>
              At each layer, you can press "left" and "right" to navigate across
              the same level, such as switching between different axes and
              legend or moving between data groups and individual data points.
            </p>
            <p>
              Press the tab key to navigate to the chart where you hear the
              following prompt: "Please use the arrow keys or WASD keys to
              navigate this chart object."
            </p>
            <p>
              To use arrow keys without conflict, you may need to turn on/off a
              certain mode in your screen reader, and you may not use trackpad
              navigation. Here is a way to configure the setting depending on
              your screen reader:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                VoiceOver: Quick nav toggle (press left/right at the same time).
              </li>
              <li>
                Trackpad commander: hold VO keys and rotate two fingers on the
                trackpad
              </li>
              <li>Windows Narrator: Scan mode off (CapsLock + Spacebar)</li>
              <li>
                NVDA: Focus mode (Insert + Spacebar). Sometimes CapsLock instead
                of Insert!
              </li>
              <li>
                JAWS: Forms mode (press enter on the application element;
                exiting forms mode: esc and numpad plus)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If the arrow keys still do not work, you can try WASD keys
              instead. Please ask for help from the researcher if you run into
              issues.

              and a tutorial chart made accessible with this method. When you
              click the button at the bottom of this page, practice questions
              will appear underneath the chart. Please take enough time to play
